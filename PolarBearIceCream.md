# Lets-Get-Down-to-Business
Our Let's Get Down to Business TC
Our PQ group decided to start an ice cream business called Polar Bear Ice Cream, and market it as an incredible
ice cream shop in Brunswick, Maine. We have unique flavors, and a very friendly, welcoming vibe. Our tagline "Brunswick's
Beary Best" is a fun and playful combination of our company name with our attribute of being the best. The aim of Polar Bear
Ice Cream is to create a fun environment for our customers while serving them a variety of flavors to cater to their 
ice cream needs. We want to emphasize the idea that every time is a perfect time for ice cream, and we welcome everyone
to our stores at any time.
